In the zipped folder given, There is:
 - A Matlab function (CountCells.m) 
 - 3 images 
 - 1 README.txt file 
 - A report explaining the process and functions used in order to obtain the result

## Steps to run program: 
1. Once the zipped folder has been downloaded, extract the contents of the folder to the desktop
